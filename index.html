            <p>The entire Le Monde Gourmand perfume line is impressive, as it is. But factoring in that it's the cheapest perfume on this list you can try.</p>

            <p>Delicious, adult vanilla. I usually go for clean scents but this one doesn’t give me a headache. This one feels flirty without being too sweet, perfect for date night.</p>

        <h1>About the Products</h1>
        <p>Testers literally say this perfume smells like "home," or like hugging a loved one. Why? Well, because it smells like a human and not a perfume, IMO. It's very subtle and light, with notes like musk, sandalwood, and jasmine—all of which just blend together in a dreamy, skin-like way. I actually love wearing this perfume to sleep (along with the body lotion and hand cream) because the scent is so comforting.

            Key notes: Skin musk, sandalwood, jasmine, bergamot
            Size: 0.32, 1.7 oz
            Cosmo review: "When I want something that smells *sexy* but not overly strong (especially during the day), I dab on Phlur Missing Person. I’m not typically a fan of musky scents, but there’s something about this one that’s so subtle and interesting. It settles nicely into your skin in an ‘I naturally smell this good’ sort of way, even on a hot, sweaty summer day. Hours after application, people will still be telling you that you smell amazing, and it lingers on whatever you wore for days." — Sarah Maberry, commerce writer</p>
